90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text was scraped in four parts from Hindawi by Peter Verkinderen, the headers from that website were automatically converted to mARkdown. Gowaart then cleaned up the mARkdown and combined the four files into one file in the correct order. The digital text itself is based on the 1928 Cairo edition by Zirikli and is of high quality, except for the pagination which is not noted on the webpage and thus not present in this file.
